# Steam Review Project

The main contents of the project can be viewed in ***Steam_Review_Analysis.ipynb***

## Overview
In this project we will be obtaining and analysing review data from Steam. I decided to look at "Elden Ring" since it is a recent and popular game with a lot of review data to work with. To begin with we will analyse some of the additional data we receive alongside the reviews, and then the review content itself. We will analyse the words contained in the reviews and try to build a classifier to tell apart positive reviews from negative.
